# Kirby-Run
My attempt at making a platformer game. I drew all of the sprites on my own.
I decided to use Kirby as the main character for the game. This project is not done yet. Still need to add a health bar, enemies, and update a few sprites.

Controls:
F to shoot <br />
<img src="shoot.gif" width="480" height="360"/>

R to kick <br />
<img src="kick.gif" width="480" height="360"/>

W to jump <br />
<img src="jump.gif" width="480" height="360"/>

W + E to glide <br />
<img src="glide.gif" width="480" height="360"/>
